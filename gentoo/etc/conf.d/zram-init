# For each device, specify
#   type, size, maxs, algo, flags, opts, mode, owgrm, notr
# The last 4 are ignored for type swap but not for the other types.
# Specify as empty if unneeded.
# type0, type1, ... are the variables for the types.
# size0, size1, ... are the variables for the sizes.
# maxs0, maxs1, ... are the variables for the maximal (parallel) streams.
# algo0, algo1, ... are the variables for the compression algorithms.
# flag0, flag1, ... are the variables for the flags.
# Except for swap:
# opts0, opts1, ... are the variables for the mount options.
# mode0, mode1, ... are the variables for the directory mode.
# owgr0, owgr1, ... are the variables for the directory owner:group.
# notr0, notr1, ... are the flags for "do not trim (discard)" (if nonempty)
# (set notr* to a nonempty value only for linux-3.14 or earlier or when you
# are prepared to waste a lot of memory for a possibly slight speed increase)
#
# The size is in megabytes.
# If the size is 0 (or empty) the device is ignored by the script.
#
# Available types:
# "swap"  The device is initialized as a swap device.
#         The flags variable specifies the priority (16383 if empty).
#         Use "-" in the flags variable for the default priority (-1)
# "/..."  The device is mounted on /...
#         The flags variable specifies the type (ext2 or ext4, default is ext4)
# Devices with other types are ignored by the script
#
# Only variables with numbers  0 ... num_devices-1  are used by the script.
