## About the license

I use simple, permissive, non-copyleft licenses unless there's a compelling reason to do otherwise. This project uses the MIT license. Note that I consider "copies or substantial portions of the Software" to mean "very substantial". There is no need to clutter code with copyright notices just to copy a few functions.

Attribution appreciated but not required.
